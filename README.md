# 5-Day MERN App
## Description
To further my skills in the MERN stack, I selected an online tutorial called **[Build a MERN Stack App in 5 Days](https://dev.to/rohanjsx/build-a-mern-stack-app-in-5-days-the-introduction-19i7)** by GitHub user [@kishibe-rohan](https://github.com/kishibe-rohan). The target of the project is to build a Quora-like question-and-answer platform, requiring 
* React front end with Tailwind CSS styling
* Google Firebase for user authentication 
* MongoDB database to handle questions and replies
* Node JS and Express for routing

I worked with my mentor [Tiffany Conroy](https://github.com/theophani) to follow and troubleshoot the tutorial. 

## Challenges
According to the tutorial writer, "This series is meant to be a beginner-friendly introduction to the MERN stack to devs who are acquainted with React and NodeJS." As the tutorial developed, however, notable information was left unclarified or simply missing. This required expert oversight and a lot of sleuthing, including among the code published of the final app. This final code differed from the tutorial, but it was not clear whether the tutorial or the code came first.

Although I completed the assignment with Tiffany's aid, it is for the reasons stated above that **neither of us would recommend this tutorial to others, whether learners or experienced developers**.
